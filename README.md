# tSrcCompiled
all python files are compiled

<h1>how to run</h1>

rename the folder "tSrc" and put universal outside, example:

if this folder path is C:/Users/user/Desktop/tSrc/ universal.exe path has to be: C:/Users/user/Desktop/universal.exe

run universal.exe and it will copy files in the main directory, later u can make a link to help.exe on ur desktop but WAIT,

the link redirect has to be in C:/tSrc/help.exe and not in DownloadFolder/help.exe . don't worry, universal will copy that 

file in C:/ dir for u! make a link or simply search "help" in the search bar on the left-top of ur windows layout.
